# Traffic Sign Image Classification

## Overview

The Traffic Sign Image Classification project is a machine learning application designed to classify traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Developed as a Jupyter Notebook, this project leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a CNN model that accurately predicts the class of traffic signs from images. The model is trained on the "GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark" dataset and achieves an accuracy of approximately 94% on the test set.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network:** Utilizes a CNN model built with TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves ~94% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating effective learning and prediction capabilities.
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Trained on 39,209 images spanning 43 classes and evaluated on 12,630 test images.
- **Statistical Evaluation:** Employs various statistical methods to evaluate model performance, including accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
- **Research-Based:** Built upon extensive research, including insights from 45 studies on CNNs, image classification, and data preprocessing.

## Dataset

The project uses the [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) dataset from Kaggle, which includes:

- **Training Set:** 39,209 images
- **Test Set:** 12,630 images
- **Classes:** 43 different traffic sign categories

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** Programming language for development.
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** Libraries for building and training the CNN model.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for code development and testing.
- **scikit-learn:** Used for statistical analysis and evaluation.
- **seaborn:** Library for visualizing the confusion matrix and other data plots.
